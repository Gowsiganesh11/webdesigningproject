        <p>John and Jane met on a backpacking adventure in Nepal. John, a former sheep shearer, went on the trip to get some clarity about his next adventures in life. Jane — a Peloton instructor — went on the trip to explore the landscape in Nepal.</p>
         <br>
        <p>While on the trip, John and Jane realized that they had one common love — the love for hiking and the love for being outdoors.</p>
        <br>  
        <p> Returning back to their home state of Oklahoma, John and Jane hatched a plan to launch a retail store centered around their passions.</p>
        <br>  
        <p> While John handled the sourcing of goods and customer service, Jane focused on the web + e-commerce side of the business, building this website in the best design platform on the web — Webflow!</p>
        <br>  
        <p>In 1989, John and Jane Doe officially launched Acme Outdoors, the premiere store for outdoor enthusiasts around the state.</p>
        <br>   
        <p> To this day, John and Jane return to Nepal yearly to ensure that they never forget their roots and where they came from.</p>
